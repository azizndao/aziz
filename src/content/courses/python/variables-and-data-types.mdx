# Variables and data

Variables and data types are fundamental concepts in Python programming. They allow you to store and manipulate different types of data. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the world of variables and cover the most commonly used data types in Python. You will learn how to declare variables, understand their scope, and use various data types effectively.

## Variables in Python

### Declaring Variables

In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare their type. You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (`=`). Here's an example:

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
```

In this example, the variable `name` is assigned the string value `"John"`, and the variable `age` is assigned the integer value `25`.

### Variable Naming Rules

When naming variables, it's important to follow these rules:

- Variable names can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores.
- Variable names cannot start with a digit.
- Variable names are case-sensitive, so `myVariable` and `myvariable` are considered different variables.
- Choose descriptive and meaningful variable names to enhance code readability.

## Common Data Types in Python

Python supports several built-in data types that can be assigned to variables. Let's explore the most commonly used data types and see how to manipulate them.

### Numeric Types

- **int**: Represents integer values, such as `1`, `2`, `-3`, etc.
- **float**: Represents floating-point values with decimal places, such as `3.14`, `2.5`, `-0.75`, etc.
- **complex**: Represents complex numbers in the form `a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers, and `j` represents the imaginary unit.

Here's an example that demonstrates these numeric types:

```python
# Integer
age = 25
print(age + 5)  # Output: 30

# Float
pi = 3.14
print(pi * 2)  # Output: 6.28

# Complex
c = 2 + 3j
print(c.conjugate())  # Output: (2-3j)
```

### Text Type

- **str**: Represents strings of characters, enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). For example, `'Hello, World!'` or `"Python"`.

  Here's an example of using strings:

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"
print(len(greeting))  # Output: 13

message = 'Python is awesome!'
print(message.upper())  # Output: PYTHON IS AWESOME!
```

### Boolean Type

- **bool**: Represents boolean values, which can be either `True` or `False`. Booleans are used in conditional statements and logical operations.

Here's an example:

```python
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False

if is_raining:
    print("Remember to take an umbrella.")
elif is_sunny:
    print("Don't forget your sunglasses!")
else:
    print("Enjoy the day!")
```

### Sequence Types

- **list**: Represents an ordered collection of elements, enclosed in square brackets (`[]`). Lists can contain elements of different data types and can be modified.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
fruits.append("grape")  # Add an element to

 the list
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']

print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(len(fruits))  # Output: 4
```

- **tuple**: Similar to lists, but tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once defined. Tuples are enclosed in parentheses (`()`).

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[0])  # Output: 10
print(coordinates[1])  # Output: 20
```

- **range**: Represents a sequence of numbers, often used in loops and iterations.

```python
numbers = range(1, 10)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

### Mapping Type

- **dict**: Represents key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces (`{}`). Dictionaries allow you to store and retrieve values using unique keys.

```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 25, "country": "USA"}
print(person["name"])  # Output: John
print(person.get("age"))  # Output: 25
person["age"] = 30  # Update the value
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'country': 'USA'}
```

## Conclusion

Understanding variables and data types is essential for writing effective Python code. By knowing how to declare variables, follow naming conventions, and utilize the various data types, you can create powerful and flexible programs. Remember to consider the specific characteristics and behaviors of each data type when manipulating them.
