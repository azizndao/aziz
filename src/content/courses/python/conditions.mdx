Conditions and operators are fundamental concepts in Python that allow us to control the flow of our programs based on specific criteria. In this article, we will explore different operators used in conditions and provide code snippets to demonstrate their usage. Let's get started!

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values and determine their relationship. Here are the commonly used comparison operators:

### Equal to (==) Operator

The equal to operator (`==`) checks if two values are equal. It returns `True` if the values are equal and `False` otherwise. Here's an example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x == y:
    print("x is equal to y")
else:
    print("x is not equal to y")
```

In this code snippet, we compare the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is not equal to `y`, the output will be "x is not equal to y".

### Not Equal to (!=) Operator

The not equal to operator (`!=`) checks if two values are not equal. It returns `True` if the values are different and `False` if they are equal. Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x != y:
    print("x is not equal to y")
else:
    pr
print("x is equal to y")
```

In this example, we compare `x` and `y`. Since `x` is not equal to `y`, the output will be "x is not equal to y".

### Greater than (>) Operator

The greater than operator (`>`) compares whether the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. It returns `True` if the left value is greater and `False` otherwise. Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is not greater than y")
```

In this code snippet, we compare `x` and `y`. Since `x` is not greater than `y`, the output will be "x is not greater than y".

### Less than (\<) Operator

The less than operator (`<`) checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right. It returns `True` if the left value is smaller and `False` otherwise. Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("x is not less than y")
```

In this example, we compare `x` and `y`. Since `x` is less than `y`, the output will be "x is less than y".

### Greater than or Equal to (>=) Operator

The greater than or equal to operator (`>=`) checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right. It returns `True` if the left value is greater or equal and `False` otherwise. Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x >= y:
    print("x is greater than or equal to y")
else:
    print("x is neither greater nor equal to y")
```

In this code snippet, we compare `x` and `y`. Since `x` is not greater than or equal to `y`, the output will

be "x is neither greater nor equal to y".

### Less than or Equal to (\<\=) Operator

The less than or equal to operator (`<=`) checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right. It returns `True` if the left value is smaller or equal and `False` otherwise. Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x <= y:
    print("x is less than or equal to y")
else:
    print("x is neither less nor equal to y")
```

In this example, we compare `x` and `y`. Since `x` is less than or equal to `y`, the output will be "x is less than or equal to y".

## Logical Operators

Logical operators allow us to combine conditions and perform logical operations on them. Here are the commonly used logical operators:

### and Operator

The `and` operator returns `True` if both conditions are true, otherwise it returns `False`. Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x < 10 and y > 5:
    print("Both conditions are true")
else:
    print("At least one condition is false")
```

In this code snippet, we use the `and` operator to combine two conditions. Since both conditions are true (`x < 10` and `y > 5`), the output will be "Both conditions are true".

### or Operator

The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the conditions is true, otherwise it returns `False`. Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x < 10 or y < 5:
    print("At least one condition is true")
else:
    print("Both conditions are false")
```

In this example, we use the `or` operator to combine two conditions. Since at least one of the conditions is true (`x < 10`), the output will be "At least one condition is true".

### not Operator

The `not` operator is used to negate a condition. It returns `True` if the condition is false, and `False` if the condition is true. Example:

```python
x = 5

if not x > 10:
    print("x is not greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is greater than 10")
```

In this code snippet, we use the `not` operator to negate the condition `x > 10`. Since the condition is true, the output will be "x is not greater than 10".

## Conclusion

Understanding conditions and operators is crucial for controlling the flow of your Python programs. By using comparison and logical operators, you can create dynamic and responsive code. Experiment with different operators and conditions, combine them effectively, and practice constructing meaningful conditions to build robust programs.
